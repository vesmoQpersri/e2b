- Lighting analysis tools: You can easily optimize your lighting setup and measure the illumination levels in your scene with the new lighting analysis render elements. You can also use the false color display mode to visualize the light distribution in your scene.
- Improved image-based lighting: You can use the new dome light to create realistic and natural lighting from HDR images. The dome light also supports portal lights, which can improve the lighting quality and speed in interior scenes.
- Car paint material: You can create realistic and complex car paint materials with the new VRayCarPaintMtl. This material allows you to control the base color, flake color, flake density, flake size, flake orientation, coat color, coat strength, coat glossiness, and coat thickness.
- Dispersion in refractions: You can simulate the effect of light splitting into different colors when passing through transparent materials with the new dispersion option in the VRayMtl. This can create realistic effects such as rainbows, prisms, diamonds, and gemstones.
- VRayLensEffects: You can add post-processing effects such as glare, bloom, streaks, and lens dust to your renders with the new VRayLensEffects render element. You can also use a texture map to control the shape and intensity of the effects.
